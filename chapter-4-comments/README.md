# Chapter 4: Comments

## Comments Do Not Make Up for Bad Code

* A common motivation for comments is bad code.
* Clear & expressive code with few comments is far superior to cluttered & complex code with lots of comments.
* Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess.

## Explain Yourself in Code

It takes only a few seconds of thought to explain more of your intent in code. &#x20;

In many cases it's simply a matter of creating a function that says the same thing as the comment you want to write.
