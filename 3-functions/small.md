# Small!

## 1st Rule

Functions should be small.&#x20;

## 2nd Rule

They should be smaller then that.

## Blocks and Indenting

* Blocks within `if`, `else`, and `while` statements should ideally be one line long.
  * The line should probably be a function call.
* Functions should not be large enough to hold nested structures.
  * The indent level of a function should not be greater than one or two.
  * Why? Readability & comprehension.
