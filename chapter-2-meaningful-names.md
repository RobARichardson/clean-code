# Chapter 2: Meaningful Names

## Use Intention-Revealing Names

1. Choosing good names takes time, but saves more than it takes.
2. The name of a variable, function, or class should answer all the big questions.
   1. Why does it exist?
   2. What does it do?
   3. How it is used?

## Avoid Disinformation

1. Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of the code.
2. Spelling similar concepts similarly is _information._ Using inconsistent spellings is _disinformation_.

## Make Meaningful Distinctions

1. It is not sufficient to add number series or noise words to satisfy the compiler. If names must be different, then they should also mean something.
   1. Number-series naming (a1, a2, ...aN) is the opposite of intentional naming.
   2. Noise words are a meaningless distinction&#x20;
      1. Examples: Product vs. ProductInfo & ProductData.
      2. Examples: getActiveAccount(), getActiveAccounts(), and getActiveAccountInfo().
   3. Noise words are often redundant.
2. Distinguish names in such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer.

## Use Pronounceable Names
