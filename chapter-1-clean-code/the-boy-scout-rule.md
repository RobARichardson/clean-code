# The Boy Scout Rule

{% hint style="info" %}
If we all checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, the code simply could not rot.
{% endhint %}

* It's not enough to write the code well. Code must be _kept clean_ over time.
* Code rot and degradation happens as time passes. Messes build quietly.
* We must take an active role in preventing that degradation.
