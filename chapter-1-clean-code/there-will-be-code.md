# There Will Be Code

## Does clean code matter?

* Claims that code will soon be generated instead of written are nonsense.
* We will never be rid of code, because code represents details of the requirements.
  * At some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they must be specified.
  * Specifying requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them is _programming_.

Code is the language in which we ultimately express the requirements!
