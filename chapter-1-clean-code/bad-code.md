# Bad Code

{% hint style="info" %}
**Wading**: The experience of being significantly impeded by bad code.

## Why do we write bad code?

* Were you trying to go too fast? Were you in a rush?
* Perhaps you felt that you didn't have time to do a good job; your boss would be angry if you took the time to clean up your code.
* Perhaps you were tired of working on this program and wanted it to be over.

## We've All Done It

* We've all looked at the mess we've made and chosen to leave it for another day.&#x20;
* We've all said we'd go back & clean it up later.
* LeBlanc's Law: "Later equals never"
