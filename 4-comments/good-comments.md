# âœ… Good Comments

### Legal Comments

These are copyright & authorship statements. &#x20;

Where possible, refer to a standard license or external document instead.

### Informative Comments

Sometimes a comment can provide useful, basic information. Comments like this should be rare though - a function name is typically better suited for this job.

### Explanation of Intent

Sometimes a comment goes beyond just useful information about the implementation and provides the intent behind a decision. These comments help convey what the programmer was trying to do, especially when the implementation may not be immediately obvious or well understood.

### Clarification

Sometimes it can be helpful to explain the meaning of an obscure argument or return value. A clarification comment can be especially helpful when code can't be altered (i.e. a third party lib).

### Warning of Consequences

These are useful warnings to other developers about certain consequences.

### TODOs&#x20;

TODO comments are jobs that the programmer thinks should be done, but for some reason can't do at the moment. However, these are not an excuse to leave bad code in the system.  Code should not be littered with TODOs.

### Amplification

These comments amplify the importance of something that may otherwise seem inconsequential.

### XML Docs in Public APIs

If you're writing a public API, then you should certainly write good docs for it.
