# Final Words

## Don't Hesitate

* People are often afraid of renaming things for fear that some other developers will object.
* We do NOT share that fear and find that we are actually grateful when names change (for the better).
* You will probably end up surprising someone when you rename (just like any other code improvement). Don't let it stop you in your tracks.
