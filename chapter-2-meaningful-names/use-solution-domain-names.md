# Use Solution Domain Names

{% hint style="info" %}
There are lots of very technical things that programmers have to do. Choosing technical names for those things is usually the most appropriate course.
{% endhint %}

* The audience of our code will be programmers.
* Use computer science terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth.
* It is not wise to draw every name from the problem domain.
