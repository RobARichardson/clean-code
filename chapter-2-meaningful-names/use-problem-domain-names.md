# Use Problem Domain Names

{% hint style="info" %}
When there's no "programmer-eese" for what you're doing, use the names of the problem domain.
{% endhint %}

* Code that has more to do with problem domain concepts should have names drawn from the problem domain.
* This allows readers of the code to ask a domain expert.
* Separating solution & problem domain concepts is part of the job of a good programmer & designer.
