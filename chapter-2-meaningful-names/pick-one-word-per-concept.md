# 1️⃣ Pick One Word per Concept

{% hint style="info" %}
A consistent lexicon is a great boon to the programmers who must use your code.
{% endhint %}

* Use one word for one abstract concept and stick with it.
* It's confusing to have `fetch`, `retrieve`, and `get` as equivalent methods of different classes.
* Likewise, it's confusing to have a `controller`, `manager`, and `driver` in the same code base.
